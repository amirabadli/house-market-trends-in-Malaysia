# 🏘️Regional & Demographic Trends in Malaysia’s Housing Market (2021–2024)

This is part of a community project organized by *[Wanita Data](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wanitadata_it-is-tonight-at-8-pm-7-teams-40-people-activity-7370376499243180032-ZTUF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADS-q9MBB4wzFiHkUq3nQUZ8gSQ0cdoIt9A)*.

My team analyzed regional price movements, demographic preferences, property types, demand vs affordability, and time trends. The findings were summarized into an infographic for public communication.

## 👩‍💻My Contribution
- Analyzed regional housing price trends and affordability gaps.
- Conducted time-series analysis on property prices.
- Created Python visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn) for affordability and demand.
- Contributed to infographic design, ensuring clarity and storytelling.

## 🔑Key Insights:
- Urban properties are 60% more expensive than rural ones.
- Almost 70% of houses bought are lower cost homes, at prices lower than RM500K.
- Small homes can be surprisingly expensive especially in prime areas while bigger homes don't always mean pricier.
- Landed properties prices remained stable at ~RM400K within 2021-2024 but high rise properties are increasing steadily over the years.

## 🛠️Tools & Libraries
- Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
